# Deep Leaning

Work from the [Deep Learning](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) on Udacity:

## Content

### Lesson 1

- Train a logistic classifier using stochastic gradient descent

### Lesson 2

- Train a simple Deep Network: Relus, chain rule and backpropagation
- Regularize a simple Deep Network: L2 regularization and dropout
- Train a competitive Deep Neural Network via model exploration and hyperparamater tuning

### Lesson 3

- Train a simple convolutional neural net
- Explore the design space for convolutional neural nets

### Lesson 4

- Train a text embedding model using models like Word2Vec. Reduce the dimensionality of the space using tSNE.
- Train a LSTM model, and regularize it.
